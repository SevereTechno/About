        <h1>About Severe Techno</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Severe Techno is a brand that has evolved over the years, starting from its early days of research and development to becoming a recognized name in technology. Here’s our journey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2004: Research began, leading to the establishment of <strong>Severe Technologies</strong>.</li>
                <li>March 2010: The first website was launched for <a href="https://severetechno.github.io/Download-Microsoft-Office/" target="_blank">Microsoft Office downloads</a>.</li>
                <li>2009: A side channel was created for various websites, starting with <strong>Bhatt Tech</strong>.</li>
                <li>2017: Another branch, <strong>Niragle</strong>, was added to expand the scope of services, leading <strong>Bhatt Tech</strong> to rename to <strong>Niragle</strong>.</li>

            <h2>Key Changes in Branding</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The name <strong>Severe Techno</strong> unintentionally started to replace Severe Technologies in 2010 due to text length restrictions in URL for my first website, a website for Downloading the latest version of Microsoft Office.</li>
                <li>The journey progressed further with the rebranding of the YouTube channel to <strong>NiraWare</strong> in 2022.</li>
                <li>The deleted channel was replaced with a new channel with name <strong>Geeky Studios</strong>.</li>
                <li>The channel was further renamed to <strong>Geeky People</strong> and later to <strong>Geeky Neeru</strong>.</li>
                <li>The channel was later renamed <strong>Severe Techno</strong> in July 2024 to align with the brand identity.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>YouTube Channel History</h2>

                <li>On May 11, 2024, the channel was removed by YouTube due to a false allegation of “dangerous content”, which was incorrect as the content did not violate any guidelines.</li>
